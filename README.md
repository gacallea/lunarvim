# my lunarvim setup

this repo holds my lvim customization files.

lunarvim is an amazing effort to create a great IDE on top of neovim. check it out: https://www.lunarvim.org

if you want to try this out, feel free to install lunarvim and then clone this repo:

```git clone https://github.com/gacallea/lunarvim ~/.config/lvim```

one day we'll toast and celebrate the death of npm like we did with flash and java?!?!
